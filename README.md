# cognito-backup ðŸ‘«â†’ðŸ’¾
Amazon doesn't have any way of backing up their AWS Cognito User Pools.
So in my frustrating times working with AWS Cognito, I wrote this tool. `cognito-backup` is a simple CLI for backing up the user data, and can also restore afterwards. <b>Note: AWS has no way of extracting the passwords of your users so you need to store these separately ðŸ˜µ</b>

### Git commit formatting

We use the `Angular git commit` style

Full (long) version:

```git commit template
<type>(<scope>): <subject>
<BLANK LINE>
<body>
<BLANK LINE>
<footer>
```

Short version

```git commit template
<type>(<scope>): <subject>
```

See https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#-commit-message-format more details

VS Code extension that helps you to make the commit msg, no need to remember your scope, etc.:

We use the allowed `types` from https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#-commit-message-format

We use custom `scopes` per repository, see `scopes` below.

#### Scopes

- config
- root
